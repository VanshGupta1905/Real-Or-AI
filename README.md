# Real-or-AI: A Deep Learning Image Classifier
Framework :Tensoflow
Library :Keras
 Model: VGG19
Detecting Wether Image is Real or AI Generated



Description:

This project tackles the fascinating challenge of distinguishing between real photographs and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models.

As AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly sophisticated, the ability to identify them has applications in combating misinformation, verifying digital content, and understanding the capabilities of AI systems.

Key Features:

Robust Model: Employs a fine-tuned VGG19 model, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture known for its strong performance in image recognition tasks.

TensorFlow & Keras: Built using the popular TensorFlow deep learning framework and its high-level Keras API for ease of implementation and experimentation.

Data-Driven Approach: Trained and evaluated on a diverse dataset containing both real photographs and AI-generated images from various sources.



Not many projects specifically focus on real vs. AI image detection. This makes it interesting to potential employers and demonstrates your ability to tackle emerging problems.

Goes beyond a simple "does it work?" approach. Includes visualization tools, a clear evaluation process, and a focus on modularity for future improvements.

Addresses a real-world issue with implications for media, security, and AI research. This showcases the value of your work beyond just the technical aspects.
