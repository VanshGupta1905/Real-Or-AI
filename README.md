Detecting Wether Image is Real or AI Generated

Project Title: Real-or-AI: A Deep Learning Image Classifier

Description:

This project tackles the fascinating challenge of distinguishing between real photographs and images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models.

As AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly sophisticated, the ability to identify them has applications in combating misinformation, verifying digital content, and understanding the capabilities of AI systems.

Key Features:

Robust Model: Employs a fine-tuned VGG19 model, a powerful convolutional neural network architecture known for its strong performance in image recognition tasks.

TensorFlow & Keras: Built using the popular TensorFlow deep learning framework and its high-level Keras API for ease of implementation and experimentation.

Data-Driven Approach: Trained and evaluated on a diverse dataset containing both real photographs and AI-generated images from various sources.
